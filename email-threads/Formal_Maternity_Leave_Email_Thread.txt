Hello Sweety,

As you have filed a complaint regarding your maternity leave, we are unable to finalize your leave request at this stage. The matter will be reviewed as part of the ongoing proceedings, and any decision on the leave will be taken only after the issue is resolved.

Hi Team,



I am compelled to write once again under extreme distress to formally document the severe, deliberate, and systematic harassment I have endured from Buzzworks Business Services Pvt. Ltd. and Wipro Limited since few months. 



There have been repeated and ongoing issues concerning my maternity leave and employment status and has unfortunately devolved into months of wilful negligence, deliberate evasion of statutory obligations, and calculated attempts to deny me my fundamental rights during pregnancy, a protected right under Indian law. 



This email must be read in continuation of all my previous communications, and as a formal protest against my illegal termination and blatant violations of my employment and maternity rights which appears to be designed to unlawfully deny me maternity benefits I am entitled to by law.



Despite my consistent, documented follow-ups since July 2025 with Buzzworks regarding my maternity leave commencing 01-November-2025, and with Wipro since August 2025, neither company has provided any written response, clarification, or resolution. My emails have been ignored, my calls dismissed, and my requests met with deliberate silence. This prolonged campaign of deliberate creation of confusion during my pregnancy has caused severe mental anguish, anxiety, sleepless nights, and emotional trauma, which constitutes workplace and mental harassment and I reserve my rights to take appropriate actions at an appropriate stage.



The following incidents illustrate the ongoing harassment and negligence by Buzzworks and Wipro:

Buzzworks’ HR Mismanagement: On Oct 7th, 2025, I received a call from Antarikshya (Buzzworks HR) regarding my work order extension with Wipro. Despite my repeated confirmations and positive responses to the extension (emails dated - Sep 24th, Sep 25th, Sep 26th, Oct 1st, Oct 4th 2025 ), I have received no written clarification or resolution. Instead, Buzzworks falsely alleges that I did not respond. Furthermore, I requested clarity on any changes to terms and maternity benefits, yet no documentation has been provided, and I was told that Wipro is responsible, a clear attempt by Buzzworks to deflect statutory liability.
Wipro’s Lack of Coordination: On the same day, I received a call from (Sumitra Tulsani) at Wipro, and was informed that Wipro has no information regarding my work order extension and have received nothing from Buzzworks. This ongoing disconnect has left me in a state of perpetual uncertainty during a medically vulnerable period and forced me to chase basic employment information while heavily pregnant. I have clearly stated my willingness to continue working under the same terms, provided my maternity rights are fully respected, yet Buzzworks continues to refuse to fulfil their legal obligations.
Denial of Statutory Rights: To date, neither Buzzworks nor Wipro has provided any written communication, except the illegal termination notice. This deliberate avoidance appears to be a clear attempt to evade statutory responsibilities under the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, and other applicable labour laws including provisions addressing gender-based workplace harassment and discrimination under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. Buzzworks, as my employer, holds direct and unambiguous liability for compliance with all statutory obligations. This is a calculated, systematic denial of rights guaranteed to pregnant women under Indian law.
The cumulative effect of these actions on the part of Buzzworks and Wipro has been devastating. This is causing me severe anxiety and stress during my pregnancy, affecting my health and that of my unborn child. I am being humiliated by being ignored and dismissed during a vulnerable life stage. This has also created financial uncertainty and insecurity when I should be preparing for childbirth. I have lost sleep, I am emotionally distressed, and feel absolutely helpless. 

I also fear retaliation from Buzzworks and Wipro for asserting my legal rights.



Nevertheless, I hereby formally demand the following, to be provided within 48 hours of receipt of this email:

Immediate revocation of the illegal termination notice and written confirmation of my continued employment status;
Complete documentation of: 
Original work order with Wipro and all amendments;
Written confirmation of current work order extension with specific end date, if extension is denied, provide proper detailed reasons for the same;
All correspondence between Buzzworks and Wipro regarding my employment;
Explanation for why these documents were never previously provided to me;
Formal written approval of maternity leave effective 01-November-2025, with:
Confirmation of all statutory maternity benefits under the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961;
Payment schedule for maternity leave wages;
Written justification if any benefits are being denied or modified
Appropriate compensation for mental anguish, emotional distress, and health impact caused by this systematic harassment during my pregnancy;
Appointment of a single point of contact at Buzzworks with authority to resolve this matter, as I can no longer tolerate being passed between departments and organizations;
Assurance against retaliation for raising these grievances, in writing.
I have acted in good faith and fulfilled all my responsibilities as an employee. It is distressing and unacceptable that, despite repeated efforts to resolve this amicably, these issues have been dragged on for months, causing undue mental suffering during my pregnancy. 



I must emphasize that I have exhausted all reasonable attempts to resolve this matter amicably. Your continued failure to act responsibly has left me no choice but to pursue all available legal remedies. 



If I do not receive a complete, written response addressing all the above demands within 48 hours I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter through formal legal channels and labour authorities, and both Buzzworks and Wipro will be held jointly and severally liable for all violations.



This email constitutes a formal notice and I await your urgent response.



Thanks & Regards,

Sweety Rai

Dear Buzzworks Team,

I am writing with deep concern as the situation calls for urgent attention.

Ever since I requested maternity leave, I have faced extreme resistance and even threats of termination of my employment with Buzzworks and also my work with Wipro. Having known Buzzworks as a reputed organization, this was not expected. To my shock, I discovered (today) that my Wipro account access has been revoked arbitrarily, without any prior intimation, despite my consent to extension of my term with Wipro on the same terms as before.

In fact, my Wipro manager has confirmed that Wipro has no difficulty in extending my term on the same terms. However, I was told that Buzzworks is unwilling to proceed with the extension. This is both surprising and distressing, since I had already communicated my consent for the extension to both Buzzworks and Wipro (please see my email dated 26 September 2025). In that same email, I also requested confirmation from Buzzworks regarding any changes in the extension terms, and sought clarity that such extension would not amount to termination of my current employment or initiation of a new one. Unfortunately, I have received no response to date.

Adding to this, I was informed by Buzzworks that my employment would be terminated at the end of this month. I have already protested this illegal termination during my pregnancy by my email dated 26 September 2025.

I also want to emphasize that my maternity leave is scheduled to begin from 1 November. I am relying on Buzzworks to cooperate in either (i) extending my placement with Wipro on the same terms as before, or (ii) providing me with suitable alternate work.

I have attempted to reach out multiple times today to Mr. Mugunth Mike and Mr. Venkat A, both via calls and messages, but have received no response.

Given the seriousness of the matter, I urge Buzzworks to take prompt and necessary steps to resolve this situation without delay.

Thank you for your immediate attention.

Sincerely,
Sweety

Buzzworks Team,

I am in receipt of your communication regarding the termination of my employment with Buzzworks effective 31 October 2025. This termination, coming immediately after my request for maternity leave beginning 1 November 2025, is unlawful and discriminatory.

I have taken legal advice, and I have been advised that:

1. Termination during pregnancy is expressly prohibited under the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961. Any such action constitutes a clear violation of statutory law and attracts strict penal and financial consequences for the employer and its officers responsible.
2. I am lawfully entitled to maternity leave, and you are under a binding obligation to grant and ensure the benefits due to me.
3. The unilateral request that I “re-onboard” with effect from 1 October 2025 is arbitrary, without cause, and contrary to the manner in which my placement with Wipro has been managed in the past (extensions were arranged directly between Buzzworks and Wipro without any re-onboarding requirement).

In light of the above, I request that you:

1. Withdraw the proposed termination of my employment and continue my employment under the existing terms and conditions with full entitlements and benefits as mandated under law;
2. Confirm my entitlement to maternity leave as per law;
3. ⁠Cease and desist from taking any steps prejudicial to my rights as an employee during my pregnancy.

Please read this email in conjunction with my email of today sent to (Mugunth Dhanaraj - mugunth.dhanaraj@buzzworks.com)

I trust Buzzworks, as a responsible employer, will take the necessary steps to comply with its statutory obligations in compliance with the law and ensure fair treatment. I look forward to your confirmation and an amicable resolution.

Regards,
Sweety

Hi Sweety,

 

Please note that your engagement with Buzzworks is governed by the validity of the client's (Wipro) Purchase Order. At present, your engagement PO is valid until 30-Sep-2025. We had already highlighted to the client the need for an extension; however, no extension has been granted so far.

 

Subsequently, we have received communication from the client regarding your re-onboarding. As part of this process, they have requested the following documents to facilitate the creation of a new PO:

 

Offer letter copy

Last three months’ payslips

PAN

Aadhaar

DNH

GAP documents

 

Based on this, the client has agreed to create a new PO extending your engagement only for one month, until 31-Oct-2025, with no further extension. This was communicated over a client call, though the formal PO documents are still awaited. Accordingly, your last working day with Wipro and Buzzworks will be 31-Oct-2025.

 

In view of the above, your engagement will not continue beyond 31-Oct-2025, and employment-related benefits will not be applicable after this date. Since Buzzworks is your payroll partner and your engagement is dependent on the client’s deployment and PO validity, we are unable to extend benefits beyond the confirmed contract period.

 

We understand the importance of your request regarding maternity leave. However, as per statutory requirements, such benefits can only be extended during an active period of employment. As there will be no valid contract of employment beyond 31-Oct-2025, we are unfortunately unable to process this request. We truly empathise with your situation and regret that we are unable to support you in this regard due to contractual limitations.

 

You are therefore advised to consider 31-Oct-2025 as your final working day under the current engagement.

 

We deeply appreciate your contributions during your tenure with us and sincerely wish you the very best in your future endeavours.

 

Regards

Venkat

Hi All,

 

This is a gentle reminder to my email on 08/09/2025. 

 

I have already provided:

  

  (a) Wipro’s no-objection for leave from 01 Nov 2025, and 

  (b) the maternity documents under the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961.

 

Given the statutory nature of these benefits and the upcoming start date, I request written confirmation of processing and any final pending steps today/tomorrow so I can plan appropriately.

 

Could you please confirm processing and share any final formalities (if any) at the earliest? This is time-sensitive for my planning.

Regards,

Sweety Rai

Hello,

As requested in your last email, I am attaching herewith the no-objection confirmation from Wipro approving my maternity leave from 01st November 2025.

Since this was the dependency cited earlier, I trust that this will now allow Buzzworks to proceed with processing my maternity leave and benefits as per the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961.

I had already submitted the required maternity documents earlier, and being asked for them again feels unnecessary and unprofessional. Nevertheless, I am attaching them here once more for your convenience.

It is in bad faith to prolong this process when eligibility is clear and confirmed by law. This repeated back-and-forth is mentally taxing during my pregnancy, and I request Buzzworks to bring this matter to closure without further delay.

I kindly request your written confirmation that my maternity leave and benefits will be processed effective 01st November 2025, along with any final formalities (if genuinely pending).

Looking forward to your confirmation at the earliest.

Best regards,
Sweety Rai

Dear Sweety,

 

Noted; However, as you are deployed at our client location (Wipro), all leaves, including maternity benefits, must be approved by the Principal Employer (your reporting manager at Wipro). Buzzworks acts as your payroll vendor, and leave requests can only be processed after client approval.

 

Kindly obtain maternity leave approval from your reporting manager and share the same with us, along with all required supporting documents for maternity leave. Once we receive the approval and supporting evidence, we will coordinate with the Principal Employer and proceed accordingly.

Hi Team,

Further to our discussion, I am formally applying for maternity leave under Sections 5 & 6 of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 (as amended in 2017).


• Expected Date of Delivery (EDD): 21/12/2025
• Proposed leave: from 1/11/2025 to 1/05/2026 (or total 26 weeks).

I have completed well over 80 days of service and therefore meet the statutory eligibility. The Act makes the employer liable to pay full wages during this period, irrespective of client approval, and overrides any inconsistent contract terms (Sec 27).

Please confirm approval of leave and the schedule for disbursement of maternity benefit so I can plan.

 

Please find attached the relevant maternity documents.

Best regards,
Sweety Rai
