Hi All,

I consent to the extension of my term with Wipro, provided there is no change in the terms of my engagement with them and/or any change in the terms of my employment with Buzzworks. I am not being informed by you why there is a requirement of sharing any further documents, as I have already shared everything with Buzzworks during my onboarding process last year. I take note that the process followed In my previous extensions with Wipro is not being followed now, and a new procedure is being required of me. 

Please clarify why there is a need for asking for these documents at this stage, especially after I have put in my request for maternity leave with you? This will help me take an informed decision especially in the event any terms are changing they need to be informed to me.

Additionally, please note that there is an ongoing discussion with other members of your team regarding my maternity leave and benefits. 

I should also inform you that I am taking legal advice and I have been advised that any change in the terms of my employment with Buzzworks at the time of my pregnancy will be in contradiction to law and will not be enforceable against me under law.

Finally, I request that all communication be kept strictly via email.

Thank you for your understanding.
Sweety

Dear Sweety Rai,

As discussed, the client has requested the DNH and GAP declaration forms. You had mentioned that you need some time to share the forms while seeking clarifications from your friends. However, there has been no response from you on this.

Request you to kindly provide us with a tentative timeline for submission so that we can update the client accordingly, as they are looking to extend your contract on an immediate basis.

 

Thanks & Regards,
