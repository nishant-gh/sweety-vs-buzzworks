This is regarding my wife's ongoing battle with Buzzworks regarding her maternity leaves which Buzzworks has been denying for several months.

Let's focus on Buzzworks's latest response to NCW in @NCW_Email_Thread.txt. You can read the email and also find details of their response in document titled "@From_Buzzworks_Sweety_Rai_Response_To_NCW.txt" (it was originally an image PDF which I have converted to text). Also for context any document which starts with From_Buzzworks\_ (I added this prefix for clarity) was attached by Buzzworks in their response email to NCW today.

Some more context about the documents attached by Buzzworks:

1. "@From_Buzzworks_Letter_To_Sweety_Rai.md" - Never seen by Sweety earlier. Sent to her permanent address and not her preferred communication address where she currently lives. The address is not wrong but it is not the address where she currently lives. No email regarding this. Also this document is dated 4th October 2025. If you look at email thread "@email-threads/Formal_Maternity_Leave_Email_Thread.txt" you can find that there were emails from Sweety on Sep 26, Oct 1, Oct 4, Oct 9 and Oct 31 with no reply from Buzzworks in between those.

2. "@From_Buzzworks_Passthrough_Agreement_PO_eTeams_Buzzworks.md" - Never shared with Sweety before. We need to find its relevancy in Buzzworks’s stand in denying maternity benefits. Also find holes in their narrative. The document may be contradictory to their own narrative of not being responsible for maternity benefits.

3. "@From_Buzzworks_Sweety_Rai_PO.md" - Never shared with Sweety before. Signed by "Irfan Bhat" on "12-08-2024" and Sweety's name is in the document. It's weird as this is before the recruiter from Buzzworks had sent email with Job Description (JD) to Sweety so interviews had not started even.

You need to help us draft reply documents against Buzzworks's response to the NCW Chairperson. The documents should focus on:

- Rebuttal to Buzzworks's claims based on facts
- Holes/conflicts in their own narrative
- Holding them accountable
- Any other thing you see suiting our goal of getting Sweety justice.

We need to have a formal/legal, confident and assertive tone. No emojis, unnecessary capitalizations, etc. Structure and flow of the documents should be impactful.

I suggest you to read as many files as needed to be factually correct and not miss any crucial detail.
