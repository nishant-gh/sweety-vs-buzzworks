Subject: Contract Closure Notification and Asset Handover

Dear Sweety Rai,

As  per  the  request  from  our  customer,  Wipro,  we  were  required  to  submit  the
necessary documents for work order extensions. Accordingly, we from Buzzworks
had reached out to you seeking the required support. However, since we did not
receive any response from your end, the extension process could not be completed.

Therefore, in line with the existing work order terms, we confirm that your contract
has ended effective 30th September 2025.

We sincerely thank you for your association during the contract period and greatly
appreciate your contributions towards the project.

We kindly request you to return the allocated assets to the customer location and
obtain an acknowledgment of the same.

Thanking you

For Buzzworks Business Services Pvt. Ltd.,

Authorised Signatory
