## Exhibit F: Points for Investigation

### Recommended Areas of Inquiry:

1. **Purchase Order Authentication**: Verification of how Mr. Irfan Bhat could sign a document dated August 12, 2024, containing Ms. Rai's name prior to recruitment

2. **Email Server Records**: Subpoena of Buzzworks's email server to establish:
   - Receipt confirmation for September 26, 2025 response
   - Explanation for absence of replies
   - Evidence of October 4, 2025 termination email transmission

3. **Postal Verification**: Confirmation of whether termination letter was dispatched via registered post

4. **Witness Examination**:
   - Antarikshya (HR) - Regarding October 7, 2025 communication
   - Mugunth Dhanaraj - Concerning "no response" assertion
   - Venkatasubbu - Regarding termination decision

5. **Client Verification**: 
   - Wipro's position on extension
   - Documentary evidence of refusal

6. **Pattern Investigation**:
   - Number of pregnant women terminated by Buzzworks

## Exhibit G: Critical Documentary Evidence

### Five Key Pieces of Evidence:

   - Directly contradicts "no response" assertion
   - Demonstrates willingness to continue employment
   - Contains legitimate clarifications

2. **October 7, 2025 Phone Communication**: HR contact regarding extension after alleged October 4 termination
   - Indicates termination letter was potentially backdated
   - Reveals procedural irregularity

3. **Purchase Order Date August 12, 2024**: Temporal impossibility
   - Suggests document manipulation
   - Indicates systematic irregularities

4. **Absence of Email Termination**: Deviation from established communication pattern
   - Suggests deliberate avoidance of documentary trail
   - Indicates lack of good faith

5. **October 31, 2025 Retaliation**: Blocking leave after NCW complaint
   - Demonstrates retaliatory intent
   - Shows awareness of wrongdoing

---

## Conclusion

The documentary evidence establishes that Buzzworks:
- Made false statements regarding receipt of responses
- Potentially manipulated or backdated documents
- Violated the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961
- Engaged in pregnancy-based discrimination
- Retaliated against assertion of legal rights

This represents not merely a misunderstanding but a deliberate, systematic attempt to deny statutory rights through misrepresentation and documentary manipulation.

Justice requires both remedial action and accountability measures to deter similar violations and protect the rights of pregnant women in the workforce.
