Dear Ms. Bipasha Barua,

**Re: Case No: 8/C250020384/2025/NCW/M(AM)/BB**
**Complainant:** Ms. Sweety Rai
**Respondent:** Buzzworks Business Services Pvt. Ltd.

I am writing in response to the communication received from Buzzworks Business Services Pvt. Ltd. dated November 10, 2025, regarding the above-referenced matter.

I hereby submit my comprehensive rebuttal to the assertions made by Buzzworks, along with documentary evidence establishing material misrepresentations in their response to the Commission.

## Documents Attached for the Commission's Consideration:

1. **Executive Brief for the Chairperson** - Highlighting three critical pieces of evidence demonstrating documentary irregularities and systematic pregnancy discrimination
2. **Comprehensive Rebuttal Document** - Point-by-point refutation of Buzzworks's assertions with supporting evidence
3. **Supplementary Evidence Document** - Detailed timeline, evidence matrix, legal precedents, and analysis of contradictions
4. **Supporting Email Correspondence** - Demonstrating responses from me that directly contradict Buzzworks's claims

## Key Points Requiring Immediate Commission Attention:

### 1. False Assertion of Non-Response
Buzzworks claims "no response from employee" despite my documented email dated **September 26, 2025 at 1:57 PM**, wherein I explicitly provided consent for extension with reasonable conditions. This email directly contradicts their primary assertion.

### 2. Documentary Irregularities
- **Purchase Order dated August 12, 2024** - Signed before my recruitment process began, raising authenticity concerns
- **Termination Letter dated October 4, 2025** - Never received via email despite established communication protocols
- **Critical employment documents** - Withheld throughout my tenure and produced only after NCW intervention

### 3. Violation of Maternity Benefit Act, 1961
The termination was effectuated immediately after my maternity leave request, violating Section 12 of the Act, which prohibits dismissal during pregnancy and prescribes criminal penalties.

### 4. Timeline Demonstrating Retaliation
- July 30, 2025: Maternity leave application submitted
- September 26, 2025: My documented response with consent
- October 1, 2025: System access terminated without notice
- October 4, 2025: Alleged termination (never communicated via email)
- October 31, 2025: Maternity leave blocked citing NCW complaint (retaliatory)

## Urgent Relief Requested:

Given my **Expected Delivery Date: December 21, 2025** (40 days from today) and the ongoing denial of statutory maternity benefits since November 1, 2025, I respectfully request the Commission's immediate intervention to:

1. Direct Buzzworks to immediately approve and process maternity leave with full statutory benefits
2. Order payment of maternity benefit wages effective November 1, 2025
3. Direct reinstatement by revoking the illegal termination
4. Investigate the documentary irregularities and potential forgery identified
5. Initiate prosecution under Section 12 of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961
6. Order appropriate compensation for mental anguish and harassment during pregnancy

## Additional Information:

I wish to emphasize that despite five documented email communications from my end (September 26, October 1, October 4, October 9, and October 31, 2025), Buzzworks maintained complete silence while simultaneously claiming I was "non-responsive." This pattern of conduct constitutes workplace harassment and gender-based discrimination during pregnancy.

The documentary evidence attached establishes that Buzzworks has not merely made procedural errors but has engaged in deliberate misrepresentation to evade statutory obligations. Each day of delay compounds the harm to both my health and financial stability during this critical pregnancy period.

I remain available for any clarifications, additional documentation, or personal appearance before the Commission as may be required. I can be reached at the contact details provided below.

I trust the Commission will examine the evidence objectively and ensure that statutory protections for pregnant women are upheld with the urgency this matter demands.

**Respectfully submitted,**

**Sweety Rai**
Complainant
