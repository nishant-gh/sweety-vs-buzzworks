**Date:** November 11, 2025

**To:**  
The Chairperson  
National Commission for Women  
Plot No. 21, Jasola Institutional Area  
New Delhi - 110025

**Subject:** Comprehensive Rebuttal to Response dated November 6, 2025, from Buzzworks Business Services Pvt. Ltd., with Documentary Evidence of Misrepresentation and Violations of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961

---

## Executive Summary

Buzzworks Business Services Pvt. Ltd. has submitted a response that contains demonstrable inaccuracies, internal contradictions, and misrepresentations of fact designed to evade their statutory obligations under the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961. This rebuttal presents documentary evidence establishing that:

1. Buzzworks's claim of non-receipt of documents is contradicted by email evidence showing Ms. Sweety Rai responded multiple times with explicit consent
2. Critical employment documents were systematically withheld from Ms. Rai throughout her tenure
3. The termination was effected in retaliation for her maternity leave request and timed to avoid statutory benefit obligations
4. Buzzworks is improperly attempting to shift statutory liability despite being the direct employer

---

## Section 1: Buzzworks's Claim of Non-Responsive Behaviour is Demonstrably False

### Statement by Buzzworks:
> "Even after repeated reminders and requests via email dated 24-09-2025 there was no response from the Employee and no documents were received from her end."

### Documentary Evidence Contradicting This Statement:

**A. Email dated September 26, 2025 (1:57 PM) - Explicit Response from Ms. Rai:**
Ms. Rai's email clearly states:
> "I consent to the extension of my term with Wipro, provided there is no change in the terms of my engagement with them and/or any change in the terms of my employment with Buzzworks."

**B. Documented Pattern of Communication from Ms. Rai:**
- September 26, 2025: Detailed response providing consent with reasonable conditions
- October 1, 2025: Follow-up communication regarding arbitrary termination of system access
- October 4, 2025: Escalation to senior management
- October 9, 2025: Formal complaint documenting harassment
- October 31, 2025: Final reminder regarding maternity leave commencement

Despite this documented communication trail, Buzzworks failed to respond to any of these emails while simultaneously claiming Ms. Rai was "non-responsive."

---

## Section 2: Critical Documentation Withheld from Employee

### Documents Attached by Buzzworks but Never Previously Shared with Ms. Rai:

**1. Purchase Order - Temporal Inconsistencies:**
- Signed by Irfan Bhat: August 12, 2024
- Issue identified: This date precedes Ms. Rai's recruitment process
- Inference: Document authenticity requires verification

**2. Passthrough Agreement:**
- Never disclosed to Ms. Rai during employment
- Reveals complex subcontracting arrangement not disclosed at hiring
- Contradicts the direct employment relationship represented in the offer letter

**3. Contract Closure Letter dated October 4, 2025:**
- Not transmitted via email despite established communication protocols
- Allegedly dispatched to permanent address in Patna rather than current Bengaluru residence
- No proof of delivery or receipt provided
- Document dated subsequent to maternity leave request

---

## Section 3: Chronological Analysis Demonstrating Retaliatory Intent

### Timeline of Events:

1. July 30, 2025: Ms. Rai submits maternity leave application (Expected Delivery Date: December 21, 2025)
2. August - September 2025: Buzzworks introduces procedural obstacles and unprecedented approval requirements
3. September 24-26, 2025: New "re-onboarding" requirement introduced without precedent
4. September 26, 2025: Ms. Rai provides written consent with reasonable clarifications
5. September 30, 2025: Purchase Order allegedly expires (not communicated contemporaneously)
6. October 1-4, 2025: Ms. Rai's system access terminated without prior notice
7. October 4, 2025: Termination letter allegedly issued (never received by Ms. Rai)
8. October 21, 2025: National Commission for Women notice received by Buzzworks
9. November 6, 2025: Buzzworks produces previously undisclosed documents

The chronological pattern strongly suggests that termination was effectuated to circumvent maternity benefit obligations.

## Section 4: Internal Inconsistencies in Buzzworks's Narrative

### Inconsistency 1: Extension Process
- Buzzworks's current position: Extension requires re-onboarding with new documentation
- Ms. Rai's documented experience: Previous extensions processed automatically without re-onboarding
- Evidence: September 26 email demonstrates Ms. Rai questioned this unprecedented requirement

### Inconsistency 2: Communication Methodology
- Established pattern: All prior communications conducted via email
- Alleged termination: Transmitted via physical mail to incorrect address
- Deviation: No email notification provided despite email being the primary communication channel

### Inconsistency 3: Documentation Requirements
- Initial request (September 24): Limited to DNH and GAP declaration forms
- Current claim by Buzzworks: Multiple documents required including offer letter, payslips, etc.
- Ms. Rai's position: All documentation previously submitted during initial onboarding in 2024

## Section 5: Misrepresentation of Statutory Liability

### Buzzworks's Legal Position:

Statement by Buzzworks:
> "As per Section 21 of The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, the Principal Employer shall be responsible..."

### Correct Legal Position:
1. Primary Liability: Under the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, the immediate employer (Buzzworks) bears primary liability for maternity benefits
2. Section 21 of CLRA: Provides for recovery mechanisms from principal employer, not absolution of contractor's primary liability
3. Judicial Precedent: Established case law confirms contractors cannot evade maternity benefit obligations by citing client arrangements

### Evidence of Direct Employment Relationship:
- Offer letter issued by Buzzworks
- Salary disbursements from Buzzworks
- Employment relationship established with Buzzworks
- Provident Fund and ESIC contributions made by Buzzworks

---

## Section 6: Violations of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961

### Statutory Violations Identified:

**1. Section 12 - Prohibition of Dismissal During Pregnancy:**
The Act states: "No employer shall discharge or dismiss any woman entitled to maternity benefit during or on account of her pregnancy"
Prescribed Penalty: Imprisonment extending to one year and/or fine up to ₹5,000

**2. Section 5 - Right to Maternity Benefit:**
Ms. Rai completed substantially more than the requisite 80 days of service, establishing eligibility regardless of contractual status

**3. Section 11 - Prohibition Against Forfeiture:**
Maternity benefits cannot be forfeited due to procedural issues or contract expiry

---

## Section 7: Evidence of Systematic Harassment

### Documented Pattern of Conduct:

1. Withholding of critical employment documents throughout tenure
2. Introduction of artificial procedural barriers following maternity leave request
3. Failure to respond to multiple communications while alleging non-response
4. Termination of system access without prior notice or communication
5. Production of previously undisclosed documents only after regulatory intervention
6. Transmission of termination notice to incorrect address

This pattern of conduct constitutes workplace harassment and gender-based discrimination during pregnancy under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.

---

## Section 8: Statements Requiring Verification

### Assertions by Buzzworks Requiring Investigation:

1. "No response from the Employee" - Contradicted by documented email correspondence
2. "1-month notice was served" - No email evidence exists; physical mail claim unsubstantiated
3. "Unable to renew the Purchase Order" - Ms. Rai provided consent on September 26, 2025
4. "Invoice has been rejected by Principal Employer" - No documentary evidence provided
5. "Documents were required from the Employee" - Previous extensions did not require such documentation

---

## Section 9: Relief Sought

Based on the documentary evidence presented, we respectfully request the Commission to:

### Immediate Relief:
1. Direct Buzzworks to immediately approve and process maternity leave with full statutory benefits
2. Order payment of maternity benefit wages effective November 1, 2025
3. Direct reinstatement by revoking the illegal termination

### Investigation and Accountability:
4. Investigate the authenticity of documents produced by Buzzworks, particularly the Purchase Order dated August 12, 2024
5. Examine why critical employment documents were withheld from Ms. Rai
6. Verify actual delivery of the alleged termination notice dated October 4, 2025
7. Initiate prosecution of responsible officers under Section 12 of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961

### Systemic Remedies:
8. Direct the Labour Commissioner to audit Buzzworks's treatment of pregnant employees
9. Order appropriate compensation for mental anguish and harassment during pregnancy
10. Issue guidelines preventing contractor-based circumvention of maternity benefits

### Documentary Requirements from Buzzworks:
11. Proof of delivery for the October 4, 2025 letter
12. Email server records demonstrating receipt and response to Ms. Rai's communications
13. Documentation of previous extension procedures demonstrating past practices
14. Written communication from client allegedly refusing extension
15. Explanation for Purchase Order bearing date prior to recruitment commencement

---

## Section 10: Conclusion

Buzzworks's response represents a calculated attempt to mislead the Commission through misrepresentation of facts and suppression of evidence. The documentary record establishes:

- Ms. Rai responded to all communications from Buzzworks
- The termination was effectuated to avoid maternity benefit obligations
- Critical documents were systematically withheld from the employee
- The termination violates Section 12 of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961

This case transcends individual grievance and highlights systemic exploitation of pregnant women within India's information technology contracting ecosystem. Buzzworks's conduct establishes a concerning precedent wherein companies utilize contracting arrangements to circumvent fundamental rights guaranteed under law.

The evidence necessitates not merely remedial action but accountability measures to deter similar violations. For pregnant women facing employment discrimination, justice delayed constitutes justice denied.

We trust the Commission will examine the evidence objectively and ensure that statutory protections are upheld.

## Appendix: Summary of Key Discrepancies

| Buzzworks's Assertion | Documentary Evidence | 
|----------------------|---------------------|
| "No response from employee" | Emails dated September 26, October 1, 4, 9, 31, 2025 demonstrate responses |
| "Documents not received" | September 26, 2025 email confirms consent provided |
| "1-month notice served" | No email evidence exists; incorrect address used for physical mail |
| "PO expired September 30" | Extension discussions continued through September 24-26 |
| "Cannot provide benefits" | Law establishes primary liability with immediate employer |
| "Client refused extension" | No documentary evidence provided |
| "Proper termination procedure" | Letter dated October 4; NCW complaint filed October 21 |

The documented pattern demonstrates systematic misrepresentation to evade legal obligations.
