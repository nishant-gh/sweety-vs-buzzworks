---

**November 11, 2025**

Dear Chairperson,

This brief presents critical evidence of documentary irregularities and pregnancy-based discrimination by Buzzworks Business Services Pvt. Ltd. against Ms. Sweety Rai, requiring urgent intervention by the Commission.

---

## Case Overview

- Pregnant employee applies for statutory maternity leave (July 30, 2025)
- Employer introduces unprecedented procedural obstacles (August-September 2025)  
- Employee provides all required clarifications and consent (September 26, 2025)
- Employer falsely claims "no response received" and effects termination (October 4, 2025)
- Documentary evidence contradicts employer's assertions
- Employer produces previously undisclosed documents only after NCW intervention
- Clear violation of Section 12 of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 (criminal offense)

## Three Critical Pieces of Evidence

### Evidence Item 1: Documented Misrepresentation
**Buzzworks's Assertion:** "No response from employee after repeated reminders"  
**Documentary Evidence:** Email dated September 26, 2025 at 1:57 PM demonstrates clear response from Ms. Rai  
**Finding:** Buzzworks has made false statements to the Commission

### Evidence Item 2: Temporal Impossibility
**Document in Question:** Purchase Order signed August 12, 2024  
**Issue Identified:** Signature date precedes Ms. Rai's recruitment process  
**Finding:** Document authenticity requires immediate verification

### Evidence Item 3: Procedural Irregularity
**October 4, 2025:** Alleged termination letter (not sent via email, incorrect postal address)  
**October 7, 2025:** Buzzworks HR contacts Ms. Rai regarding extension  
**Finding:** Termination documentation appears to have been created retroactively

## Broader Implications for Women's Rights

### Beyond Individual Grievance:
This case exposes a systematic vulnerability in India's information technology sector wherein:
- Contractors terminate women employees prior to maternity leave commencement
- Complex subcontracting arrangements obscure employer liability  
- Pregnant women face employment insecurity during their most vulnerable period
- Companies misrepresent facts to statutory authorities without consequence

### Precedential Concerns:
Should Buzzworks's conduct go unchallenged:
- Similar practices will proliferate across the IT contracting sector
- Thousands of women will lose effective maternity protection
- The Maternity Benefit Act's protections will be rendered ineffective
- The Commission's enforcement authority will be undermined

---

## Undisclosed Information

Key facts Buzzworks has concealed:
1. Employment documents (Purchase Orders, Agreements) were never shared with Ms. Rai during her tenure
2. Previous contract extensions were processed automatically without re-onboarding requirements
3. Communication ceased after Ms. Rai's maternity leave request
4. The termination letter was not sent via email, departing from all established communication protocols
5. Ms. Rai's maternity leave continues to be blocked following the NCW complaint (retaliatory conduct)

---

## Requested Commission Actions

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. Summon Buzzworks officials for examination under oath
2. Order immediate reinstatement and maternity benefit payment
3. Obtain email server logs to verify receipt of September 26, 2025 response

### Investigative Actions:
4. Verify the Purchase Order signature date (August 12, 2024) for authenticity
5. Examine postal records for alleged October 4, 2025 termination letter
6. Obtain statement from Wipro regarding extension refusal claims

### Systemic Interventions:
7. Audit Buzzworks for patterns of pregnancy-based discrimination
8. Issue comprehensive guidelines on contractor obligations for maternity benefits
9. Refer matter for criminal prosecution under Section 12 of the Maternity Benefit Act

---

## Impact on the Complainant

While Buzzworks engages in documentary manipulation and misrepresentation, a pregnant woman experiences:
- Financial hardship during critical pregnancy period
- Severe psychological stress affecting maternal and fetal health  
- Loss of health insurance coverage during pregnancy
- Career disruption for exercising statutory rights
- Systematic harassment for asserting legal entitlements

Expected Delivery Date: December 21, 2025  
Maternity Leave Commencement: November 1, 2025  
Days of Unlawful Denial: 10 days and continuing

---

## Analysis of Buzzworks's Response

Their submission can be summarized as follows:
1. False assertion regarding non-receipt of responses (contradicted by email evidence)
2. Attribution of responsibility to client without supporting documentation
3. Reliance on subcontracting arrangements to evade statutory obligations
4. Production of previously undisclosed documents of questionable authenticity

The effort invested in constructing this narrative exceeds what would be required for simple legal compliance.

## Relevant Legal Framework

### Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 - Section 12:
"When a woman absents herself from work in accordance with the provisions of this Act, it shall be unlawful for her employer to discharge or dismiss her during or on account of such absence or to give notice of discharge or dismissal on such a day that the notice will expire during such absence"

Prescribed Penalty: Imprisonment up to one year  
Classification: Criminal offense

---

## Pattern Requiring Regulatory Intervention

### Critical Questions for Investigation:
- How many pregnant women has Buzzworks terminated proximate to maternity leave?
- Why are fundamental employment documents withheld from employees?
- How was a Purchase Order signed before recruitment commenced?
- Where are the documented responses to Ms. Rai's five email communications?
- Why was termination communicated via post when all prior communication was electronic?

These inquiries will likely reveal systematic discrimination requiring sector-wide regulatory reform.

## Commission's Statutory Powers

The National Commission for Women possesses authority to:
- Summon and examine witnesses under oath
- Discover and produce any document  
- Receive evidence on affidavits
- Requisition public records
- Issue commissions for examination
- Recommend prosecution for violations

This case warrants exercise of the Commission's full statutory authority to address documentary fraud and protect women's rights.

---

## Conclusion and Appeal

Honorable Chairperson,

The evidence before the Commission is unambiguous:
- Email correspondence contradicts Buzzworks's assertions
- Documents suggest potential forgery
- The timeline indicates retaliatory intent  
- The law mandates criminal prosecution

Each day of delay:
- Emboldens discriminatory employers
- Denies a pregnant woman her statutory rights
- Undermines the rule of law

The matter requires immediate intervention, not prolonged investigation.

Women across India's workforce require assurance that during pregnancy - their most vulnerable period - the law and this Commission will protect them from employers who view maternity benefits as costs to be avoided through deception.

We respectfully urge swift and decisive action to ensure justice.

### For Immediate Clarification:
[Contact Information]

**Note:** When statutory protections for pregnant women can be circumvented through documentary irregularities and misrepresentation to regulatory authorities, the failure extends beyond individual injustice to systemic breakdown of legal protections for all working mothers in India.
