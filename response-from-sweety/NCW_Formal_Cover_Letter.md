**Subject:** Response to Communication from Buzzworks Business Services Pvt. Ltd. - Case No: 8/C250020384/2025/NCW/M(AM)/BB

---

Respected Madam,

With reference to the above-mentioned case and the communication dated November 10, 2025, received from Buzzworks Business Services Pvt. Ltd., I hereby submit my comprehensive response refuting their assertions and establishing violations of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961.

I am enclosing the following documents for the Commission's kind consideration:

1. **Executive Brief for the Chairperson** - Summary of critical evidence and requested actions
2. **Comprehensive Rebuttal to Buzzworks's Response** - Detailed point-by-point refutation
3. **Supplementary Evidence Document** - Timeline, exhibits, and legal analysis
4. **Copies of Email Correspondence** (September-October 2025) - Documentary evidence

The enclosed documents establish conclusively that:

- Buzzworks has made false statements to the Commission regarding non-receipt of my responses
- Critical employment documents were systematically withheld from me
- My termination violates Section 12 of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961
- Documentary irregularities suggest potential manipulation and backdating

With my expected delivery date of December 21, 2025, rapidly approaching and maternity benefits unlawfully denied since November 1, 2025, I respectfully request the Commission's urgent intervention as detailed in the enclosed submission.

I remain available for any clarifications, additional documentation, or personal appearance before the Commission.

Thanking you for your attention to this matter of urgent importance.

**Yours sincerely,**

[Signature]
